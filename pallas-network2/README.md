# Pallas Network 2

An implementation of the Ouroboros networking stack. The `pallas-network2` crate is a new take on the whole networking approach that prioritizes P2P operations over the _client-server_ approach used in the prior version.

At some point, once this new version is thoroughly tested and adopted by downstream clients, `network2` will replace the original one.
