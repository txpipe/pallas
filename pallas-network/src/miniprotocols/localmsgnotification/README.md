# LocalMsgNotification

:warning: This is a work in progress and not yet fully implemented.

The local message notification mini-protocol is used to receive messages from a local DMQ node.

The full protocol is defined in the [CIP-0137](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0137#local-message-notification-mini-protocol).
