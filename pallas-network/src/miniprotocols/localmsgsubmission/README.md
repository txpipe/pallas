# LocalMsgSubmission

:warning: This is a work in progress and not yet fully implemented.

The local message submission mini-protocol is used to submit messages to a local DMQ node.

The full protocol is defined in the [CIP-0137](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0137#local-message-submission-mini-protocol).

Note: the implementation of this mini-protocol is based on the local transaction submission protocol generic implementation.
