# Key Evolving Signatures

`kes` is a pure rust implementation of Key Evolving Signatures, following the paper
from ["Composition and Efficiency Tradeoffs for Forward-Secure Digital Signatures"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/034)
by Malkin, Micciancio and Miner. In particular, we implement the "sum" composition, from Section
3.1. As a depth zero signature algorithm we use Ed25519 using the `strict` verification criteria from
[`ed25519_dalek`](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek), which is the same as currently
used in [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).

This library defines macros to generate KES algorithms with different depths. We currently expose KES
algorithms up to depth 7. However, if you require a higher depth key, feel free to open an
issue/PR.

This module requires the `kes` feature flag.

## Library usage

This library exposes `SumXKes` for `X` in [2,7]. A KES algorithm with depth `X` can evolve the key
`2^X`. When a secret key is evolved, the old seed is overwritten with zeroes.

```rust
use pallas_crypto::kes::summed_kes::Sum6Kes;
use pallas_crypto::kes::traits::{KesSig, KesSk};

fn main() {
    let (mut skey, pkey) = Sum6Kes::keygen(&mut [0u8; 32]);
    let dummy_message = b"tilin";
    let sigma = skey.sign(0, dummy_message);

    assert!(sigma.verify(0, &pkey, dummy_message).is_ok());

    // Key can be updated 63 times
    for i in 0..63 {
        assert!(skey.update(i).is_ok());
    }
}
```

**Note** Cardano uses currently **Sum6Kes**.

## Compatibility with Cardano
We provide two implementations of KES for compatibility with Cardano's blockchain. Cardano currently
uses `Sum6Kes` which is supported here.
As that implementation is not optimal in what concerns signature size,
we provide implementation of `SumCompact6Kes`, which provides an asymptotic halving of the signature
size. We provide test vectors generated using Cardano's code to ensure that future changes in the
library will not lose compatibility with Cardano. These test vectors can be found in `./data`,
and the tests can be found in `summed_kes_interoperability.rs`.

## Interoperability with cardano-node and cardano-cli

Secret keys of this crate are not compatible with KES keys as they are used in the
[cardano node](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node). In this crate we include the
period of the KES secret key as part of its structure, while the cardano implementation does not.
This decision is motivated by two reasons:
* It considerably simplifies the API and makes it more intuitive to use. Moreover, the period is
  a required knowledge to sign/update a skey, and we concluded that a secret key should contain it's
  period.
* Secret keys are not send through the wire, meaning that a node using this implementation will not
  need to be compatible with cardano node's serialisation. However, if for some reason one needs to
  serialise a cardano node serialised key for usage in this application (or vice-versa), one simply
  needs to add the period as a 32 bit number represented in 4 big endian bytes (or, vice-versa,
  remove the last 4 bytes from the serialised signature). An example of such a procedure can be found
  in the [interoperability](summed_kes_interoperability.rs) tests of this crate.

## Previous versions of the code
This repo is an adapted copy of
[txpipe/kes](https://github.com/txpipe/kes.git), which in turn is fork of
[kes-mmm-sumed25519](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/kes-mmm-sumed25519). The old repo
remains unchanged for historical purposes.
